# Sun Tracker

A simple canvas animation tracking the sun's position in the sky of the user's location.

[See it live in action.](https://thisancog.github.io/suntracker/index.html)

Allows geolocation via `navigator.geolocation` or IP Geolocation, depending on user preference. All astronomical calculations are done with common high accuracy algorithms (see [Reda et al](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/34302.pdf)).

Future version should rotate sun's screen position according to user device orientation.
